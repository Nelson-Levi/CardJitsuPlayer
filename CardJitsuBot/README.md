# Project Title

Card Jitsu Player


## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. Log into your Club Penguin account.
2. Enter the Card Jitsu game.
3. Run the program.

Instructions for using the software:

1. Once inside of a Card Jitsu game, run the program.
2. No more input is needed. The program will automatically play the game for you.

## Development Environment 

To recreate the development environment, you need the following software and/or libraries with the specified versions:

* Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2022 (Version 17.14.7 Preview 1.0)
* Microsoft .NET Framework (Version 4.8.09032)
* Visual C++ 2022 Redistributable (x64) (Version 14.36.32532)
* OpenCV (Version 4.11.0)

## Useful Websites to Learn More

I found these websites useful in developing this software:

* [OpenCV Official Documentation](https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/index.html)
* [I particularly used this page for template matching](https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/de/da9/tutorial_template_matching.html)
* [Various C++ resources at w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/)]

## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

* [ ] Allow the program to function on screens with different resolutions.
* [ ] Allow the program to react and adapt to different game situations, such as when card priorities are reversed or certain cards are blocked.
* [ ] Improve the card selection algorithm to react and learn from the opponent's moves.
